# 📖 File System Read & Write

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a log file that tracks the execution of code in my application.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have completed the `writeToLog` function such that it takes an input and writes the input to a new `log.txt` file.
  
* It's done when I have proper validation that checks whether the correct amount of inputs has been passed in using `process.argv`.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:
