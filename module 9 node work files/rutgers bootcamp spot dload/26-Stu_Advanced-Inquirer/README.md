# 🏗️ Build CLI App with Inquirer

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a command-line application that takes in input from the user and does something with it.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have initialized my repository with a `package.json` file by running `npm init -y`.

* It's done when I have installed inquirer version 8.2.4 and added it to my list of dependencies by running `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`.

* It's done when the application asks the user, `What is your name?`, and the message is displayed with the color `bright magenta`.

* It's done when the application asks the user, `What languages do you know?`, and the message is displayed with the color `bright magenta`.

* It's done when the application asks the user, `What is your preferred method of communication?`, and the message is displayed with the color `bright magenta`.

* It's done after I have written those responses to a file.

## 💡 Hints

* Why do we need to use `JSON.stringify`?

* Use the `inquirer` npm page to see how to use checkboxes and lists

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How would you format your JSON? Can you generate the name of your user file from the user input?
