# 🏗️ Build a Text Logger that uses Colors

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a command-line application that takes in input from the user and logs a message with a selected color to the console.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have initialized my repository with a `package.json` file by running `npm init -y`.

* It's done when I have installed `inquirer` version 8.2.4 and added it to my list of dependencies by running `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`.

* It's done when I have installed `colors` and added it to my list of dependencies by running `npm i colors`.

* It's done when the application asks the user, "What text would you like to log?".

* It's done when the application asks the user, "What color would you like to use?", and has the options "red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "cyan", and "magenta".

* It's done when the text is logged in the selected color.

## 💡 Hints

Use the `inquirer` npm page to see how to use lists and inputs.

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How could you also add some styling choices to the text logged using `colors` and `inquirer`?
