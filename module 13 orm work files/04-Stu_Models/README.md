# üêõ PostgreSQL Table Isn't Being Created to Specifications

Work with a group to resolve the following issues:

* As a developer, I want a PostgreSQL table with the same name as the Sequelize model.

* As a developer, I want a more descriptive primary key name in the PostgreSQL table.

## Expected Behavior

When Sequelize syncs the model with the database, the table name should be `book` (singular) and the primary key name should be `book_id`.

## Actual Behavior

The table name is `books`, and the primary key is `id`.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Run `npm start` from the command line to start the server and sync the database.

2. Run `psql -U postgres` to log into the PostgreSQL shell.

3. In the PostgreSQL shell, run `\c library_db;` to switch to the library database.

4. Try to run `\d book;` to describe the `book` table. It will fail because the table name is `books`.

5. Run `\d books;`. Note that the primary key is named `id` and not `book_id`.
