# 🏗️ Refactor the Code to Use `async` and `await` Instead of Promises

Work with a group to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, my database seed code should be less cluttered with Promises and instead use `async` and `await` for easier readability.

* As a developer, my `PUT` and `DELETE` route code should be less cluttered with Promises and instead use `async` and `await` for easier readability.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `bookSeeds.js` code no longer uses Promises and instead uses `async` and `await`.

* It's done when the `bookSeeds.js` code continues to successfully populate the database with sample data.

* It's done when the `bookRoutes.js` code no longer uses Promises and instead uses `async` and `await`.

* It's done when the `bookRoutes.js` code continues to successfully support `PUT` and `DELETE` requests for the `api/books/:book_id` route.

## 💡 Hints

How does JavaScript know when a function is asynchronous?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your group to further your knowledge:

* How could you run this seed file from an npm script? How would you work with multiple models in an `index.js` file?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
