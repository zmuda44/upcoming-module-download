* It's done when I implement Express.js middleware to parse URL-encoded data in my server.

* It's done when I use Insomnia to make a POST request to `api/upvotes/:review_id`, using JSON to upvote a given post by passing in: 

```json
    {
        "upvote": true
    }
```

* It's done when I use Insomnia to make a POST request to `api/upvotes/:review_id`, using URL-encoded data to upvote a given post by passing in:

```
    "upvote"="true"
```
* It's done when I verify that both POST requests return a response that contains the updated vote count.
